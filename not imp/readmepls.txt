you still can look at the files inside this folder but just a quick look i would recommend studying from the other files like

arrays2.js
backtick.js
dateobj.js
functions2.js
objects2.js
primitives.js
stringms.js
variables.js

and for the exercises check

exercises.js

my best wishes to whoever gonna study javascript from this repo
